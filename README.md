# Rock Paper Scissors

## The Project:

Another small project for [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors?ref=lnav) introductory course on web development, Web Development 101. This project
is focusing on the basics of **JavaScript functions**, and the task at hand is to implement
a simple game of rock paper scissors.

## Learning Goals:

By the end of this project I expect to know a bit more about JavaScript functions
and in order to challenge myself I'll try to utilize things such as arrow notation
that I'm a bit unfamiliar with.

## What I learned:

Remains to be seen...
